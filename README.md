<h3> HTML5 multiplayer game </h3>
The task is to create real time (but low processor load) single player vs AI or multiplayer game. Put emphasis on algorithms, scaling, speed, and of course HCI. The game must run on web browser (and preferably on phone browser as app).
In this project, we're delving into the development of an HTML5 top-down shooter game. Our goal is to create an engaging gaming experience that offers both multiplayer and singleplayer modes.
